                    <p>Hi I'm Naoya Morishita!</p>
                    <p>I am currently working for a consultancy company as <em>a GIScientist for international development projects</em> in Tokyo.</p>
                    <p>I hold <em>Master in Science in Geographic Information Science</em> and <em>Bachelor of Arts and Sciences in Global Studies and Collaboration.</em>
                    <p>I'm very interested in <em>GIS for environmental science</em>, particularly in <em>quantifying landscape change</em> using metrices.</p>
                    <p>In my free time, I love traveling and reading books.</p>
                    <h3>Skills</h3>
                    <p>I can <em>analyze spatial data</em> both with GUI (<em>ArcGIS, QGIS, Terrset</em>) and programming (<em>Python, R, PostGIS, Julia, GoogleEarthEngine</em>).</p>
                    <p>I can apply the programming skills <em>to create automation tools</em> and <em>data visualization (JavaScript</em>) and just to enjoy the programming languages themselves (<em>Java</em> & little bit of Scala).</p>
                    <p>The analyses are always done with my strong background of both <em>raster and vector GIS</em>, <em>remote sensing</em>, <em>map comparison</em>, and <em>statistics</em> to build an effective workflow.</p>
                    <p>Also, from my undergraduate education, I learned theoretical backgrounds of <em>international development</em> and <em>environmental management</em> to set research questions.</p>
